10/08/2018 - 4 hours
	started first GUI for robot
	
17/08 - 4 hours
	I worked on a table that lists what action the user made, the XY coordinates, 
	and it sets the cell colour to what RGB the click was made too.
	
	Changing from AWT to JFrame...
	
21/08 - 8 hours
	Made a new, cleaner GUI that doesn't use flow layout.
	Basically put SetBounds to every component.
	Changed to JFrame.
	
	..
	
	Made so it now runs the actions through the table, as originally intended ( I had trouble wrapping my head around how to do it ).
	
23/08 - 5 hours
	Created a new JFrame that records time between clicks and stores them in an array.
	I can use the array to make the automation more (human-like). I created because some games have anti-bot detection, my array can help avoid being detected.
	
24/08 - 6 hours
	Created a screen that shows the monitor scaled down (1 : 2), I have added some methods to create vision of where the bot will click and mouse movements..
	I need to implement arrays into the method each time I click add action.
	
29/08 - 1:20 hours 
	Added a method to type letters from a string.
	
31/08 - 2 hours
	Fixing algorithms
	
18/09 - 1 hour
	Clicking at mouse cursor location method
	
19/09 - 1:30 hours
	Tweaking and fixing some things in the screen display window, and more cursor location code added.

26/09 - 1:20 hours
	Made screendisplayer show mouse movement inbetween actions. Previously, you it would only show if you added the action 'Mouse move'.
	
	More progress on the screen displayer, the type string method; it will now show a clear box with the string inside of it at set coordinates.
	
29/09 - 3 hours
	Added RGB table cell support 	
	
1/10 - 2-3 hours
	Made an algorithm that detects what a colour is from HSL values, if it is dark/light, if it is pastel or not, in a string.
	E.g. red very dark pastel 
	
10/10 - 2-3 hours
	Made code cleaner for anyone to read and added a settings window.
